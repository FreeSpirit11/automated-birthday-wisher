# 1. Update the birthdays.csv

# 2. Check if today matches a birthday in the birthdays.csv

# 3. If step 2 is true, pick a random letter from letter templates and replace the [NAME] with the person's actual
# name from birthdays.csv

# 4. Send the letter generated in step 3 to that person's email address.

#imp notes Yes, that's correct! In `pandas`, the `name` attribute of a Series object (which represents a row or a column
# in a DataFrame) returns the label of the Series. When you use `row.name` to access a value in a row of a DataFrame,
# `pandas` actually returns the label of the row, not the value in the `name` column.

#To access the value in a specific column for each row in a `pandas` DataFrame, you should use square brackets and the
# column name as a string, like this: `row['column_name']`. In your case, to access the value in the `name` column for
# each row, you should use `row['name']`.
#Therefore, it’s recommended to always use square brackets and the column name as a string to access the values in a
# specific column for each row in a pandas DataFrame.
