# Automated Birthday Wisher

The Automated Birthday Wisher is a Python script that automates the process of sending birthday wishes to friends and family via email. It reads birthday information from a CSV file, generates personalized birthday messages using letter templates, and sends them automatically on the recipient's birthday.

## Features

- Automatic Birthday Wishes: The script automatically sends personalized birthday wishes to recipients on their birthday.

- Customizable Letter Templates: You can create different letter templates with placeholders like "[Name]" to personalize the birthday messages.

- CSV Data Input: The birthday information is stored in a CSV file, making it easy to manage and update recipient details.

- Secure Email Configuration: The script uses SMTP (Simple Mail Transfer Protocol) for email communication, and the user's email credentials are stored as environment variables for security.

## How to Use

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
```
git clone https://github.com/FreeSpirit11/automated-birthday-wisher.git
```

2. Navigate to the project directory.
```
cd automated-birthday-wisher
```

3. Install the required dependencies.

4. Set up your email and password .

5. Create a CSV file named "birthdays.csv" in the project directory.
   - The CSV file should have columns "name," "email," "month," and "day" for each recipient's name, email, birth month, and birth day, respectively.

6. Customize letter templates in the "letter_templates" folder.
   - Create different letter templates with placeholders like "[Name]" to personalize the birthday messages.

7. Run the main script to send birthday wishes.
```
python main.py

8. The script will automatically send birthday wishes to recipients whose birthday matches the current date.

**Note:** Make sure to keep your email and password information safe and secure. Storing them as environment variables ensures that sensitive information is not exposed in your code.
